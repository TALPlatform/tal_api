Your task is to produce a justification report that explains how well the given candidate profile aligns with the sourcing session’s **initial filters**.

You will be given:
- Sourcing Session Name and Project Brief
- Initial Filters (required skills, industries, experience, location, etc.)
- Candidate Profile (personal info, experience, skills, education, etc.)

### Your primary goal:
Focus on the **initial filters**.  
Your analysis should revolve around how closely the candidate matches those filters.  
If some filters are not met, clearly mention them — but also highlight any compensating strengths.

### Output Format:

**Summary:**  
A short paragraph summarizing how well the candidate aligns with the initial filters.

**Filter Match Analysis:**  
- For each filter (Skills, Industry, Experience, Location, etc.), provide a one-line assessment of how the candidate meets or misses it.

**Strengths:**  
- Bullet points for major strengths related to the initial filters.

**Gaps:**  
- Bullet points for missing or weakly matched areas.

**Overall Justification:**  
Final classification as one of:  
✅ Strong Fit | ⚖️ Partial Fit | ❌ Not Fit  
Include a one-line rationale.

- Strong project history aligned with modern distributed systems.
